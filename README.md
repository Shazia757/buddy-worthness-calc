## 📌 Project Description

An app that *scans a photo of your friend* and generates a **completely fictional "buddy worthness report"** using terminal-style animations, matrix-themed backgrounds, and loads of nonsense tech.

---

## 🧠 The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People don’t know how much their friends are worth. Emotionally? No. Financially? Nope. Just pure absurd buddy metrics like "Sarcasm Level", "Fish Smell Quotient", and "Loyalty in Dog Years".

---

## 💡 The Solution (that nobody asked for)

You upload a friend’s picture → App scans it with a Lottie animation → Runs a fake AI pipeline → BOOM: Generates a **terminal-style animated report** filled with fabricated stats like "Chai Compatibility Index", "Netflix Sync Ratio", and "Trustability on a Rainy Day".
